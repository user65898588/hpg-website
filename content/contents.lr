##Welcome to Handpainter's Guild
Itâ€™s a small and personal community for enthusiasts and artists who do or appreciate handpainted and stylized gameart. The purpose is to have a small tight knit community to chat, hangout with, and practice texture painting in a low-stress environment. You can also just pop in, say a few words, and then get back to work!
